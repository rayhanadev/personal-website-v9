Hi, I'm Ray! I build things :D

Right now I'm a platform engineer at [Million](https://million.dev) (YC W24), where I work on infrastructure that lets humans build software at scale with AI agents. Before that I was at Replit fighting spam and abuse, at Deel shipping marketing tools, and a mix of SWE roles in-between. I've been doing this since I was 14!

I'm also president of [Purdue Hackers](https://purduehackers.com), where I get to create spaces for people to build wacky and ambitious things together :)

## Things I Believe In

- **Bet on young people.** Some of the best engineers I know started building before they could drive. Give them the resources, the mentorship, and the trust to go after real problems and they will surprise you. Big fan of (and alumni of!) [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com).
- **Building in open source is a must.** [Software is the only technology that can cost millions to build and still be given away for free.](https://x.com/masadfrost/status/2019276836929421602) I learned to code by reading other people's code, and I'm inspired by companies that publish the cool technology they've built for everyone to learn from and build on.
- **Always be learning.** I don't mean taking courses or reading books (though those are fine). I mean staying uncomfortable. Working on things you don't fully understand yet. Most of what I know came from jumping into projects I wasn't ready for and figuring it out along the way.
- **Infrastructure and dev tools.** I've always been drawn to the underlying tech powering what people see. I've spent a lot of time thinking about what great developers need, and there's something deeply satisfying about building the layer that makes everyone else faster.
- **Craft and magic.** The best products feel like someone gave a damn. In a world of AI-generated everything, craft still matters. I want to build experiences where every interaction feels intentional -- where someone uses it and is genuinely wow-ed by the experience.
- **American dynamism.** I grew up in Texas and it's exciting to see tech reinvigorating national interest beyond the coasts -- new companies, new infrastructure, new ambition in places that have always had the talent but not the attention.

I like hard problems and cool people. If you're working on something interesting, please [say hi](mailto:me@rayhanadev.com) :)
